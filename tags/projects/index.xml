      <description>I&#39;m starting out 2020 with a plan to be a little more rigorous about how I approach my side projects. That includes publicly writing about the details of what I&#39;m working on to both share what I&#39;ve learned and also to hold myself somewhat accountable.
With that being said, some of my general goals for 2020 include:
 Getting more experience with computer vision applications to balance my machine learning knowledge, which up to this point has mostly focused on natural language applications Gaining better understanding of the process involved in building custom electronics and hardware Re-visiting a failed side project from 2018 (more on that below)  My 2020 project is to build a cheap camera-based depth sensing system that can create detailed 3D point clouds, accurately measure distance, detect motion and do simple object identification and classification.</description>
