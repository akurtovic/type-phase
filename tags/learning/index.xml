      <description>In a previous post I wrote about the power of explicitly stating the obvious fact that there is no magic. The idea being that, once you convince yourself of this, there is nothing stopping you from learning and understanding what previously seemed magical.
If you were, for example, trying to reverse engineer a technology or learn a new scientific or engineering discipline, this exercise can quickly give you the positive affirmation you need to get started.</description>

      <description>Technology is the application of scientific knowledge to produce practical results. Magic is the use of mysterious or mystical forces to achieve supernatural results. In other words, they are opposites.
Yet too often in common parlance, we conflate the two. Apps promise to wow us with &amp;ldquo;magical&amp;rdquo; user experiences. Pundits talk about algorithms wielded like &amp;ldquo;magic spells&amp;rdquo; by modern-day wizards, often to much financial benefit. AI startups promise machine learning models that give &amp;ldquo;magical insights&amp;rdquo; into the inner workings of your company.</description>
